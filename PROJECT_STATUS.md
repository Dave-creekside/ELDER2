# ELDER Project Status - July 31, 2025

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Features

1. **Unified Tabbed Dashboard**
   - Location: `frontend/elder-dashboard.html`, `frontend/elder-dashboard.css`, `frontend/elder-dashboard.js`
   - Four tabs: Graph, Galaxy, Health, Terminal
   - Clean separation of chat UI from system logs
   - Each visualization loads in isolated iframes

2. **Real-time Health Monitoring**
   - Location: `frontend/health.html`
   - WebSocket endpoint: `get_health_stats` in `dashboard.py`
   - Displays:
     - Hypergraph Brain stats (Neo4j)
     - Language Model configuration
     - Docker Services status
     - Vector Memory (Qdrant) stats
     - System Performance metrics

3. **Hausdorff Dimension Integration**
   - Added to health stats calculation in `dashboard.py`
   - Uses `calculate_hausdorff_dimension` tool from Neo4j server
   - Displays dimension and R-squared values in Health tab

### ‚úÖ FIXED: Health Stats Display & Performance Issues

**Problem 1**: Hypergraph Brain tile was showing all zeros despite data existing in Neo4j

**Root Cause**: Field name mismatch between Neo4j server response and dashboard parsing:
- Neo4j returns: `concept_count`, `semantic_relationships`
- Dashboard expected: `node_count`, `edge_count`

**Problem 2**: Health tab was continuously polling for stats even when hidden, causing excessive tool calls

**Solutions Implemented**:

1. **Fixed field mapping** in `dashboard.py`:
   - Match exact tool names with underscores: `neo4j_hypergraph_get_graph_stats`
   - Map field names correctly: `concept_count` ‚Üí `node_count`, `semantic_relationships` ‚Üí `edge_count`
   - Add better logging and error handling

2. **Implemented visibility tracking**:
   - Parent dashboard (`elder-dashboard.js`) sends visibility messages to iframes
   - Health page only refreshes when visible
   - Auto-refresh stops when tab is hidden
   - Refresh interval increased from 5s to 10s

3. **Optimized Hausdorff calculation**:
   - Only calculates on first tab activation
   - Subsequent auto-refreshes skip hausdorff (unless manual refresh)
   - Backend accepts `calculate_hausdorff` parameter

**Test Results**:
- Graph stats: 42 concepts, 10 relationships  
- Hausdorff dimension: 0.522112 (R¬≤ = 0.947)
- No background polling when tab is hidden
- Hausdorff only calculates once per session

### üìù Recent Changes

1. Fixed SyntaxWarning in `dashboard.py` by using raw strings for regex patterns
2. Added logging to track graph stats results
3. Updated health monitoring to use real tools instead of synthetic data

### üîç Debug Information Added

In `dashboard.py`:
```python
logger.info(f"Graph stats result: {stats_result}")
logger.info(f"Parsed stats: {stats}")
logger.info(f"Neo4j stats to return: {neo4j_stats}")
```

### üìã Next Steps

1. Check server logs for the actual graph stats being returned
2. Verify Neo4j database state directly (via Neo4j Browser or cypher-shell)
3. Test the `get_graph_stats` tool independently
4. Investigate if there's a project context issue (default vs. specific project)

### üõë Stable Stopping Point

The dashboard infrastructure is complete and functional. The issue appears to be with data retrieval from Neo4j, not with the dashboard implementation itself. All UI components are working correctly and will display data once the database query issue is resolved.
